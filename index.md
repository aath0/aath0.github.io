Our group is using electrophysiological and computational techniques to study functions of the human brain in health and disease.

Research focus:

* Neural functions in coma and sleep
* Neural correlates of auditory processing and predictions
* Machine learning algorithms for electrophysiological data

To investigate these topics we are using electrophysiological recordings in humans (scalp EEG, intracranial EEG/ECoG, single unit activity), in combination with machine learning algorithms (multivariate decoding for EEG signals, deep learning algorithms).

We are part of the [Institute of Computer Science](https://www.inf.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) at the Faculty of Science, and of the [Experimental Neurology Center -ZEN-](https://neurologie.insel.ch/de/lehre-und-forschung/forschung/research-resources/standard-titel) Department of Neurology, Inselspital University Hospital Bern, and [University of Bern](https://www.inf.unibe.ch/index_eng.html), in Switzerland.
