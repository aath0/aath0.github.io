Our group is using electrophysiological and computational techniques to study functions of the human brain in health and disease.

Research focus:

* Neural functions in coma and sleep
* Neural correlates of auditory processing and predictions
* Machine learning algorithms for electrophysiological data

To investigate these topics we are using electrophysiological recordings in humans (scalp EEG, intracranial EEG/ECoG, MEG, single unit measurements), in combination with machine learning algorithms (multivariate decoding for EEG signals, deep learning algorithms).

We are part of the [Institute of Computer Science](https://www.inf.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) at the Faculty of Science, and of the Department of Neurology, at the Faculty of Medicine, at the [University of Bern](https://www.inf.unibe.ch/index_eng.html), in Switzerland.
