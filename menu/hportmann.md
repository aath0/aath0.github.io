#### Bio
I hold a BSc in Biomedical Sciences and a spMSc in Digital Neuroscience, both from the University of Fribourg. 
I conducted my Master’s thesis at the UPD Bern, where I developed machine learning models for sleep staging and age prediction from sleep EEG data. 
This sparked my interest in using computational methods in sleep research and motivated me to pursue a PhD in the Cognitive Computational Neuroscience group. 
For my PhD, I am using computational methods and intracranial EEG data to study oscillations during human sleep and I am excited to contribute to our understanding of neural processes during sleep.
