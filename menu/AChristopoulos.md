#### Bio
I hold a BSc in Psychology and an MSc in Behavioural and Cognitive Neurosciences with a specialization in Cognitive Neuroscience and Cognitive Modelling from the University of Groningen. From the beginning of my scientific career, I have been deeply interested in the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning. My work has focused on developing robust Brain-Computer Interface systems, either through novel feature extraction methods or custom Deep Learning architectures. My goal is to understand human neurophysiological markers and computationally represent them. Currently, my research involves intracranial EEG, aiming to disentangle auditory processing stages and ultimately reconstruct complex auditory representations from neural activity.
