Our research uses computational and machine learning techniques to study functions of the human brain in health and disease. Our work focuses on three main axes:

* [Neural functions in coma and sleep](#neural-functions-in-coma-and-sleep)
* [Learning and predictions](#learning-and-predictions)
* [Machine learning techniques for neuroscience](#machine-learning-for-analysing-physiological-data)
<br/><br/>
## Neural functions in coma and sleep

When consciousness fades away we are not aware of our surroundings. However, our brains continue to process information from the environment, like sounds. <br/>
In our work, we are investigating how the human brain responds to stimuli of the environment when consciousness is lost. Moreover, we are combining electrophysiological measurements of brain activity with computational techniques, like measures of neural synchrony and complexity, to identify predictors of awakening from a coma.<br/>

## Learning and predictions

The world around us is full of rich sensory experiences, which often follow repetitive rules. For example, temporal
regularities, like the time of the day, might allow us to foresee and avoid subsequent traffic jams, or auditory events,
like the sound of a siren, could help us predict the arrival of an ambulance, or a fire truck. Through exposure to
reoccurring events we are able to learn patterns and eventually form predictions about future events before these
occur. <br/>

To shed light in the neural computations that allow us to form predictions about future events, we are using machine learning and computational modeling techniques, to study [neural activity](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn_a_00835) during learning of environmental rules.

## Machine learning for analysing physiological data

Studying neural responses to environmental stimuli through electroencephalography (EEG), typically requires averaging hundrents or thousands of single-trial responses, and contrasting them at single electrode locations. Multivariate decoding techniques are typically used to model the distribution of single-trial EEG responses across the scalp, and extract topographic EEG responses in a data-driven way. These techniques can be used to model data at the [single-patient](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027014003872) level, to decode [decisions from EEG responses](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811912001632), or to test the role of [temporal intervals in processing environmental stimuli](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811912001589).
