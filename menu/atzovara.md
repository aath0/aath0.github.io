#### Bio

Athina Tzovara is an assistant professor at the Institute of Computer Science at the University of Bern, Switzerland and a visiting scholar at the University of California Berkeley, USA. She received a diploma in electrical and computer engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, Greece in 2009, and a PhD in neuroscience from the University Hospital Centre of Lausanne, Switzerland in 2012. She then moved to the University of Zurich as a postdoctoral researcher and the University College London, UK as an honorary research associate. Before joining the University of Bern, she was doing research at the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, at the University of California Berkeley, USA. 

Her research combines modeling and machine learning techniques with invasive and non invasive recordings of neural activity in humans, to study the neural mechanisms that support human cognition.
