#### Bio
I am a student of Psychology at the University of Berne in the third year of Bachelor, with Neurosciences and Biology being my Minors. Because of my great interest in research – specifically in the domains of neuroscience, sleep, cognition, and perception – I am happy to work as a Research Assistant and help Sigurd Lekerød Alnes with his EEG-study on auditive predictive processes during sleep.
