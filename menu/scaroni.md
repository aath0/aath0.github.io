#### Bio
I have a masterâ€™s degree in Digital Neuroscience from the University of Fribourg (Switzerland), an interdisciplinary programme combining advanced training in neuroscience with practical expertise in data analytics. I joined the Cognitive Computational Neuroscience group for my thesis project, where I investigated circadian patterns in the EEG and ECG of comatose patients using signal processing and machine learning techniques. My research interests lie in computational tools and machine learning/deep learning for the diagnosis and treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders.
