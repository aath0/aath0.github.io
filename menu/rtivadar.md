#### Bio
My current research focuses on how auditory processing is modulated by different stages of wakefulness. I have previously studied visual and multisensory processes as well as sensory substitution for the visually impaired. I am particularly interested in the dynamics of cortical processes, brain plasticity, perceptual expertise, and rehabilitation. My research agenda focuses on learning how to use advanced neuroimaging and computational methods to better understand the brain mechanisms involved in functional and structural cortical plasticity with the aim of applying this to the domains of sensory and cognitive rehabilitation.
