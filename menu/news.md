* **March 2022**: Florence Aellen will be presenting a workshop at the [Applied Machine Learning Days at EPFL](https://appliedmldays.org/events/amld-epfl-2022), on the topic of: [Algorithmic Decision-Making in Neuroscience: How Can We Improve Algorithmic Interpretability and Reduce Bias?](https://appliedmldays.org/events/amld-epfl-2022/workshops/algorithmic-decision-making-in-neuroscience-how-can-we-improve-algorithmic-interpretability-and-reduce-bias)
 
* **November 2021**: New [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811921009113) characterising neural signals in patients in a coma. We show that neural synchrony of EEG responses to sounds in the first day of coma is predictive of patients' outcome three months later. [Press release](http://www.inselgruppe.ch/de/aktuell/details/news/komapatienten-guenstige-prognose-bei-gleichtakt-der-hirnzellen/) from the University of Bern.

* **September 2021**: New [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027021003022) on deep learning for EEG signals. We explore deep learning algorithms based on covolutional neural networks for EEG data, and trial by trial changes in discriminatory features.

* **July 2021**: Our new [perspective article](https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(21)00417-7.pdf) dealing with gender bias in academia and proposing concrete solutions to increase the representation of women in science is published in Neuron. We additionally have a [press release and interview](https://news.berkeley.edu/2021/07/07/for-neuroscientists-a-checklist-for-eliminating-gender-bias/) through University of California Berkeley.

* **June 2021**: Join our symposium on [Spatio-temporal Brain Dynamics Across Consciousness Levels in Clinical and Healthy Populations](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=4060) at the annual meeting of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping!

* **May 2021**: Pinar Goektepe will present her work on multivariate decoding of MEG signals to study auditory predictions at the [MEG Nord meeting](https://megnord.org/).

Children will be reviewing articles written for [Frontiers for Young Minds](https://kids.frontiersin.org), exploring functions of the brain. 

* **February 2021**: Join our [mentoring seminar for women PhD students in Computer science](https://sites.google.com/view/w-cse-mentor-seminars/home)!

* **January 2021**: [Our article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811921000197) describing the work done at the [Organization for Human Brain Mapping](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3267&pageid=1) to enhance diversity and inclusivity in an academic setting is published!

* **September 2020**: We are starting a new project to investigate bias in machine learning algorithms for biomedical data, funded from [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/). In collaboration with [Natalia Norori](https://neuro.inf.unibe.ch/menu/people.html), we will investigate how open science tools can be used to recognise and mitigate bias.

* **September 2020**: New [review article](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/abb7a5/meta) on the use of intracranial EEG to study congition in humans.

* **July 2020**: [Pinar Göktepe](https://neuro.inf.unibe.ch/menu/pgoektepe.html) finished her master thesis with title: "Machine learning techniques for classifying neural predictive processes based on magnetoencephalography". Pinar will now join our lab as PhD student.

* **June 2020**: [Flo](https://neuro.inf.unibe.ch/menu/FAellen.html) will present her work on convolutional neural networks for analyzing EEG data at the annual meeting of the [Organization for Human Brain Mapping](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3958).

* **May 2020**: [New paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16202-y) using machine learning techniques to evaluate representation of probabilistic outcomes in the human brain is now online.
