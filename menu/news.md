* **May 2020**: Our [new paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16202-y) with [Dominik Bach](http://bachlab.org/) and colleagues, using machine learning techniques to evaluate representation of probabilistic outcomes in the human brain is online.

* **March 2020**: Our new paper with [Johannes Sarthein](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/~johannes/), [Tommaso Fedele](https://www.hse.ru/en/org/persons/134977270) and colleagues from [EPI Klinik](https://www.swissepi.ch/epi-portal.html), investigating iEEG, single unit activity and BOLD responses in the amygdala is [out](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920301920?via%3Dihub).

* **December 2019**: [Corinne](https://aath0.github.io/menu/people.html) finished her Bachelor's thesis: 'Spike Sorting During an Auditory Oddball Paradigm in Humans'. Congratulations!

* **October 2019**: [Athina](https://aath0.github.io/menu/people.html) will be presenting work on intracranial EEG recordings and auditory predictions at the annual meeting for the [Society for Neuroscience](https://www.sfn.org/Meetings/Neuroscience-2019/Sessions-and-Events/Scientific-Program) in Chicago.

* **September 2019**: [Pinar GÃ¶ktepe](https://ccneuro.github.io/pgoektepe/) is joining us to work as a research assistant on the development of reproducible pipelines for algorithmic decision-making in the field of neuroscience.

* **July 2019**: We have received an Open Science grant by [Mozilla](https://medium.com/read-write-participate/announcing-9-awards-for-open-science-eaf8f5b36e85) to develop open educational resources on algorithmic decision-making in neuroscience! Great collaboration with [Chris Holdgraf](https://predictablynoisy.com/) and [Elpiniki Apostolaki-Iosifidou](https://elpiniki.io/).

* **June 2019**: Our [new paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.24689) on the use of high-precision magnetoencephalography for reconstructing sources from the amygdala and hippocampus during acquisition and extnction of threat predictions in humans is out.

* **June 2019**: [New paper](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/6/giz076/5523201) on participatory research, in collaboration with [Open Humans](https://www.openhumans.org/).
