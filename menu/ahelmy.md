#### Bio

I hold an MSc in Computer Science from the University of Bern and am part of the team who is working on the International Swiss Primary Hypersomnolence and Narcolepsy Cohort Study (iSPHYNCS). This study aims to identify novel biomarkers for central disorders of hypersomnolence, such as narcolepsy. My research focuses on leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze sleep patterns and uncover new biomarkers for these sleep disorders. I am passionate about using computational approaches to enhance the diagnosis and treatment of sleep-related conditions.
