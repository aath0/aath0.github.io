## PhD and postdoc positions

Applications are invited for two 3-year postdocs in neuroscience at the University of Bern, Switzerland. Our group is investigating the neural mechanisms that support processing of auditory information and how these are altered during sleep. We are particularly interested in how intrinsic neural timescales and neural oscillations support auditory and predictive processing in the human brain, and how those are reorganized from wakefulness to sleep. To answer these questions, we have open positions for two postdoctoral researchers, one with an experimental and one with a computational focus, motivated to contribute to our line of research.

The selected candidate with experimental focus will have the possibility to design new electroencephalography (EEG) experiments, record, and analyse scalp and/or intracranial EEG data to study links between neural timescales and auditory processing in the awake and sleeping brain. The selected candidate with computational background will have the chance to analyse rich intracranial EEG recordings from patients with epilepsy undergoing pre-surgical monitoring to study the organization of neural oscillations and connectivity patterns in sleep and wakefulness along the auditory network. 

The selected candidates will be integrated in the collaborative and international research environment of the [Center for Experimental Neurology](https://neurologie.insel.ch/de/lehre-und-forschung/forschung/research-resources/standard-titel) (ZEN) and will be supervised by Prof. Athina Tzovara.

Profile for postdoctoral position I
* Phd in neuroscience 
* Experience with designing cognitive neuroscience experiments and recording scalp or intracranial EEG data
* Experience with analysis of EEG/iEEG/ECOG data, signal processing and statistics
* Ability to independently program in Python or R
* Additional experience with one or more of the following: auditory and predictive processing, analysis of neural timescales and neural oscillations, sleep research

Profile for postdoctoral position II

* PhD in neuroscience, biomedical engineering, physics or a related discipline 
* Ability to independently analyse iEEG/ECOG data (time-frequency analyses, connectivity, modeling of neural oscillations, etc)
* Strong programming skills in Python or R
* Additional experience with one or more of the following is a plus: sleep research, analysis of single neuron recordings or machine learning for iEEG signals

What we offer:
* Interdisciplinary and collaborative research team
* International research environment
* Funding and salary for 3 years according to regulations of the Swiss National Science Foundation

Applications:
Applications will be accepted until July 31st. The positions can start on September 1st or upon agreement. To apply please send one pdf document including your CV, publication list, a brief statement of research interests and the contact details of two referees to Athina Tzovara: athina.tzovara@unibe.ch. Please also indicate which of the two positions you are interested in. Informal inquiries are welcome.

## Studying how our brains process sounds via machine learning

The human brain is characterized by rich neural dynamics, which are the result of coordinated electrical neural activity. Stimuli from our environment, like sounds, trigger strong reactions in distributed brain regions. In our recent [work](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.27.509695v2), we are studying how the human brain processes sounds from the environment via rich recordings of neural activity in patients with epilepsy. 

Computational techniques are increasingly employed to analyze the large amounts of data that are generated from invasive recordings of neural activity of the human brain. In this project, we will employ machine learning and simulation techniques to analyse neural signals, with the goal of better understanding how our brains react to sounds. These signals come with incredible temporal and spatial resolution and are thus ideal to study brain processes at the micro- and mesoscopic levels.
 
The project is suitable for a Master thesis project. The student working on it should be motivated to program indepentently in Python for analyzing rich datasets. This project will give experience with machine learning, signal processing, neuroscience and working with human data. No prior experience with neural signals analysis is required.
