## Machine learning for detecting pattern sequences in time series data

Machine learning techniques are often used in the field of neuroscience to model patterns of neural activity. Electroencephalography -EEG- is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that allows measuring time-series of electric activity of the human brain. Machine learning techniques are well established for analyzing EEG responses to external stimuli such as sounds, but there is a lack of techniques for analyzing spontaneous neural activity that occurs during rest.

The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques for modeling patterns of EEG responses to sound sequences. These models will then be used to assess a possible reactivation of the detected patterns during rest. The student working on this project will gain experience with analyzing time-series data, machine learning techniques for classification and sequence detection, and handling biomedical data.

## Signal processing and classification techniques to analyze simultaneously acquired intracranial EEG data

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a technique that measures electrical activity of the human brain, in invasive (iEEG) or non-invasive ways.

Classification algorithms have been applied in the field of neuroscience to analyse EEG responses to external stimuli. However, in the majority of cases, EEG responses are analysed for each participant separately. This allows us to examine how the brain responds to external stimuli of the environment, but without the possibility to study interactions with other humans. In a innovative recording setup, we have acquired iEEG data from patients with refractory epilepsy, who were performing simultaneously a non-verbal communication task. Our goal is to study the neural underpinnings of communication and transfer of knowledge from one patient to another.

This thesis will focus on analyzing an existing dataset of invasive electroencephalography recordings, using signal processing and machine learning techniques. The student working on this project will gain experience in advanced signal processing techniques for analyzing time-series data, invasive electroencephalography recordings and biomedical applications of classification algorithms.
This project is in collaboration with [Dr. Anais Llorens](https://knightlab.neuro.berkeley.edu/post-docs/anais-llorens).

## EEG measurements of auditory predictions during sleep

In our daily lives we are constantly immersed in streams of sensory information. Very often these do not occur in a random way but follow repetitive rules and patterns. The human brain possesses astonishing capacities of detecting patterns from the environment and predicting future events before these occur even when conscious access to the environment is reduced, e.g. during sleep. Predictive traces manifest in multiple stages of information processing, but it still remains unknown how they are modulated by conscious perception of the environment. The goal of this thesis is to study the neural mechanisms underlying the generation of sensory predictions during sleep and wakefulness. To this aim, we will perform electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in healthy volunteers, in awake and asleep conditions, while presenting them with sound sequences, following regular or irregular patterns. We are looking for a master student to help us perform overnight EEG recordings at Inselspital and assist with data analysis.
