## Postdoc position in neuroscience and machine learning

A 2-year postdoc position is available for a researcher with an interest in cognitive neuroscience, electroencephalography (EEG), and machine learning. 

The position will be based at the University of Bern, Switzerland, at the [Institute of Computer Science](https://www.inf.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) and [sitem-insel](https://sitem-insel.ch/en), under the supervision of Athina Tzovara. Our [group](https://www.inf.unibe.ch/about_us/team/cognitive_computational_neuroscience_ccn/index_eng.html) is studying the neural mechanisms underlying predictive processes in humans and their link to consciousness or decisions. We are using high-density EEG, MEG and ECoG recordings, in combination with machine learning and computational modeling techniques.

The open postdoc position will study the neural and computational mechanisms that allow humans to anticipate the outcome of their actions. Being able to plan future actions and anticipate their outcome is a crucial cross-species skill for survival. However, the temporal dynamics and computational processes underlying this neural ability in humans are underexplored.

To address this question, the selected candidate will design novel EEG experiments and use signal processing and machine learning tools to analyze EEG data. This position could be ideal for candidates with a background in computer science and a strong interest in neuroscience, or with a background in neuroscience, but with strong computational and programming skills.

*Qualifications:*

-	PhD in neuroscience, biomedical engineering, computer science, or a related discipline
-	Experience with machine learning / computational modeling
-	Experience with recording and analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) data is an advantage
-	Programming skills in python or matlab

*What we offer:*

-	Funding for 2 years following regulations of the University of Bern
-	Access to high-density scalp EEG and ECoG recordings
-	Interdisciplinary & international research environment

*Applications:*
Applications will be accepted until the positions are filled. If you are interested, please send one pdf-document including your CV, a brief statement of research interests, and the contact details of two referees to:

## Convolutional neural networks for analysing neural functions in coma

Deep learning techniques and in particular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are increasingly used in the field of neuroscience. CNNs have promising clinical applications in automating the detection of pathological patterns of neural activiy from large amounts of data.

One tool that is commonly used to measure neural functions is electroencephalography -EEG-. EEG is a non-invasive technique that measures time-series of electric activity of the brain, though electrodes placed on the scalp. EEG is used as a diagnostic tool in neurological disorders, like epilepsy or coma. EEG recordings in coma patients carry information about the integrity of neural functions in the absence of consciousness, and can be used to predict the patients' outcome and chances of survival. However, there is a lack of automatic techniques for detecting pathological patterns of EEG responses to external stimuli during coma.

This master thesis will use CNNs for classifying EEG responses of coma patients to sounds, and for linking those to patients' outcome. In our previous work, we have developped a CNN-based pipeline for classifying EEG resposnes of healthy volunteers. This master thesis will build upon this pipeline and will fine-tune its parameters and CNNs architecture for the specific case of EEG data of coma patients, whose EEG responses have higher variability than those of healthy participants. 

The student working on this project will gain experience in deep learning algorithms for biomedical data, data augmentation techniques, and in the development of clinical biomarkers.

## Information theory techniques to study neural functions in sleep

When we sleep, we process auditory stimuli from the environment around us. However, the neural mechanisms that allow the human brain to process stimuli during sleep are under-explored. Recent studies suggest that responsiveness to external stimuli in sleep is related to complexity of neural activity and levels of neuronal noise. 

Tools from the field of computer science, such as information theory or machine learning can be used to quantify the complexity of neural signals, recorded through electroencephalography (EEG). EEG is a non-invasive technique that measures electric activity of the brain through electrodes on the scalp. Measures of scale-free dynamics of neural activity can be applied on time-series of EEG signals to quantify the complexity of neural responses, or levels of neuronal noise. Interestingly, past studies suggest that the compexity of ongoing neural activity is modulated by sleep. However, it remains unknown how changes in neural complexity during sleep affect sensory processing of external stimuli (e.g. sounds). 

The focus of this thesis will be on using techniques from information theory to study complexity of EEG responses to sounds during sleep and wakefulness. The student working on this project will analyse a dataset of high-density sleep EEG recordings using signal processing and information theory techniques. Also, the student will gain experience with Python programming, processing and visualizing time-series signals. No previous experience with sleep or EEG is necessary.

## Signal processing and classification techniques to analyze simultaneously acquired intracranial EEG data

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a technique that measures electrical activity of the human brain, in invasive (iEEG) or non-invasive ways.

Classification algorithms have been applied in the field of neuroscience to analyse EEG responses to external stimuli. However, in the majority of cases, EEG responses are analysed for each participant separately. This allows us to examine how the brain responds to external stimuli of the environment, but without the possibility to study interactions with other humans. In a innovative recording setup, we have acquired iEEG data from patients with refractory epilepsy, who were performing simultaneously a non-verbal communication task. Our goal is to study the neural underpinnings of communication and transfer of knowledge from one patient to another.

This thesis will focus on analyzing an existing dataset of invasive electroencephalography recordings, using signal processing and machine learning techniques. The student working on this project will gain experience in advanced signal processing techniques for analyzing time-series data, invasive electroencephalography recordings and biomedical applications of classification algorithms.
This project is in collaboration with [Dr. Anais Llorens](https://knightlab.neuro.berkeley.edu/post-docs/anais-llorens).
