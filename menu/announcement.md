## Postdoc position in neuroscience and machine learning

A 2-year postdoc position is available for a researcher with an interest in neural predictions, electroencephalography (EEG), and machine learning. 

In our daily lives we are constantly faced with multiple decisions. Being able to anticipate the outcome of our decisions is a fundamental cross-species skill for survival. However, the temporal dynamics and computational processes underlying this neural ability in humans are underexplored. To address this question, we seek a postdoctoral research who will use a combination of EEG and machine learning techniques to study the temporal dynamics of anticipatory processes.

The position will be based at the University of Bern, Switzerland, in between the Institute of Computer Science and sitem-insel. Our group is using high-density EEG, MEG and ECoG recordings in humans, in combination with machine learning and computational modeling techniques.

The selected candidate will be expected to design novel EEG experiments and use signal processing and machine learning techniques to analyze EEG data. Moreover, they will be expected to closely collaborate with our group of PhD students and postdoc. This position could be ideal for candidates with a background in computer science and a strong interest in neuroscience, or with a background in neuroscience, but with strong computational and programming skills. 

*Qualifications:*

-	PhD in neuroscience, biomedical engineering, computer science, or a related discipline
-	Experience with machine learning / computational modeling
-	Experience with recording and analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) data is a big plus
-	Programming skills, in particular Python / R

*What we offer:*

-	Funding for 2 years following regulations of the University of Bern
-	Access to high-density scalp EEG and ECoG recordings
-	Opportunities to attend conferences & summer schools
-	Interdisciplinary & international research environment

*Applications:*
Applications will be accepted until the positions are filled. The first review of applications will begin on the 26th October 2020. If you are interested, please send one pdf-document including your CV, a brief statement of research interests, and the contact details of two referees to:  
Athina Tzovara: athina.tzovara@inf.unibe.ch
Informal inquiries are welcome.

## Machine learning for detecting pattern sequences in time series data

Machine learning techniques are often used in the field of neuroscience to model patterns of neural activity. Electroencephalography -EEG- is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that allows measuring time-series of electric activity of the human brain. Machine learning techniques are well established for analyzing EEG responses to external stimuli such as sounds, but there is a lack of techniques for analyzing spontaneous neural activity that occurs during rest.

The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques for modeling patterns of EEG responses to sound sequences. These models will then be used to assess a possible reactivation of the detected patterns during rest. The student working on this project will gain experience with analyzing time-series data, machine learning techniques for classification and sequence detection, and handling biomedical data.

## Signal processing and classification techniques to analyze simultaneously acquired intracranial EEG data

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a technique that measures electrical activity of the human brain, in invasive (iEEG) or non-invasive ways.

Classification algorithms have been applied in the field of neuroscience to analyse EEG responses to external stimuli. However, in the majority of cases, EEG responses are analysed for each participant separately. This allows us to examine how the brain responds to external stimuli of the environment, but without the possibility to study interactions with other humans. In a innovative recording setup, we have acquired iEEG data from patients with refractory epilepsy, who were performing simultaneously a non-verbal communication task. Our goal is to study the neural underpinnings of communication and transfer of knowledge from one patient to another.

This thesis will focus on analyzing an existing dataset of invasive electroencephalography recordings, using signal processing and machine learning techniques. The student working on this project will gain experience in advanced signal processing techniques for analyzing time-series data, invasive electroencephalography recordings and biomedical applications of classification algorithms.
This project is in collaboration with [Dr. Anais Llorens](https://knightlab.neuro.berkeley.edu/post-docs/anais-llorens).
