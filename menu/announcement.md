## Master theses

**Machine learning for detecting pattern sequences in time-series data**

Machine learning techniques are often used in the field of neuroscience to model patterns of neural activity. Electroencephalography -EEG- is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that allows measuring time-series of electric activity of the human brain. Machine learning techniques are well established for analyzing EEG responses to external stimuli such as sounds, but there is a lack of techniques for analyzing spontaneous neural activity that occurs during rest.

The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques for modeling patterns of EEG responses to sound sequences. These models will then be used to assess a possible reactivation of the detected patterns during rest. The student working on this project will gain experience with analyzing time-series data, machine learning techniques for classification and sequence detection, and handling biomedical data.

**EEG measurements of auditory predictions during sleep**

In our daily lives we are constantly immersed in streams of sensory information. Very often these do not occur in a random way but follow repetitive rules and patterns. The human brain possesses astonishing capacities of detecting patterns from the environment and predicting future events before these occur even when conscious access to the environment is reduced, e.g. during sleep. Predictive traces manifest in multiple stages of information processing, but it still remains unknown how they are modulated by conscious perception of the environment. The goal of this thesis is to study the neural mechanisms underlying the generation of sensory predictions during sleep and wakefulness. To this aim, we will perform electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in healthy volunteers, in awake and asleep conditions, while presenting them with sound sequences, following regular or irregular patterns. We are looking for a master student to help us perform overnight EEG recordings at Inselspital and assist with data analysis.
