## Python tutorials for machine learning on EEG data
We have developped a [series of tutorials](https://aath0.github.io/AlgorithmsNeuroscience/) for analyzing EEG data using signal processing and machine learning techniques, thanks to support from [Mozilla Science Lab](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ScienceLab). We welcome contributions through the project's [repository](https://github.com/aath0/AlgorithmsNeuroscience).

[Here](https://github.com/aath0/PIP_SummerSchoolML) you can find material for the PIP Summer school on Machine Learning, including a tutorial for applying maching learning techniques on EEG data.

## Code for EEG research:
[Scripts](https://github.com/aath0/AuditoryOddball) to create pure tones in python and to run an auditory oddball paradigm, using pygame.

Wrapper functions to import Neuralynx data in fieldtrip and transform them to .fif format, which can be then read in MNE, python. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/aath0/EEG_Neuralynx2Fieldtrip2MNE).
