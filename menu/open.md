Bellow you can find some openly available material from our lab.

#### Neuroscience-related material:
* [Open educational resources for algorithmic decision-making in neuroscience](#open-educational-resources-in-neuroscience)
* [PIP Summer School on Machine Learning](#machine-learning-for-eeg-in-python)
* [Auditory oddball paradigm in python](#auditory-oddball-in-python)
* [Scripts to import neuralynx data](#importing-neuralynx-data)

### Open educational resources in neuroscience
We have developped a [series of tutorials](https://aath0.github.io/AlgorithmsNeuroscience/) for analyzing EEG data using signal processing and machine learning techniques, thanks to support from [Mozilla Science Lab](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ScienceLab). We welcome contributions through the project's [repository](https://github.com/aath0/AlgorithmsNeuroscience).

### Machine learning for EEG in python
[Here](https://github.com/aath0/PIP_SummerSchoolML) you can find material for the PIP Summer school on Machine Learning, including a tutorial for applying maching learning techniques on EEG data.

### Auditory oddball in python
[Scripts](https://github.com/aath0/AuditoryOddball) to create pure tones in python and to run an auditory oddball paradigm, using pygame.

### Importing Neuralynx data
Wrapper functions to import Neuralynx data in fieldtrip and transform them to .fif format, which can be then read in MNE, python. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/aath0/EEG_Neuralynx2Fieldtrip2MNE).
