#### Bio

I have obtained my Bachelor's in Frontiers of Life Sciences from Paris Cité University, followed by a Master's in Life Sciences Engineering at EPFL. I specialized in computational neuroscience and completed my Master’s thesis in NeuroAI at the University of Oxford. After graduating, I worked as a research assistant in medical data science at the University of Geneva.

My research interests lie in developing interpretable machine learning models for research in neuroscience and for healthcare. My PhD focuses on analyzing the effect of insomnia medications on EEG signals and using AI to predict the influence of novel compounds on brain electrophysiology and neural activity. I am enthusiastic about exploring how deep learning can accelerate and improve drug development.
Outside of research, I can be found reading or hiking with friends.
